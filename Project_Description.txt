📊 **Analyzing Insights from a Food Delivery Business Dataset**

I recently had the opportunity to dive into a fascinating data analysis project involving a dataset from a food delivery business similar to Zomato. Using SQL queries and data visualization techniques, I uncovered valuable insights that shed light on customer behavior and business performance.

**Key Findings:**
🍽️ **Customer Spending Patterns:** By analyzing the sum of amounts spent by each user on Zomato, I identified trends in customer expenditure and highlighted top spenders.
📅 **Distinct Visit Dates:** I discovered the frequency of customer visits to Zomato by counting the distinct dates each user interacted with the platform.
🛒 **Popular Menu Items:** Through SQL queries, I determined the most purchased item on the menu and how often it was bought by users.
💳 **Points Redemption Analysis:** Utilizing transaction data, I ranked transactions by customers and analyzed the effectiveness of the loyalty program in terms of points earned and redeemed.

**Insights and Visualizations:** I visualized these insights using SQL queries and data visualization tools, making it easier to understand complex trends and patterns in customer behavior.

**Conclusion:** This project provided actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions for the food delivery business, such as optimizing menu offerings, improving customer engagement, and refining the loyalty program.

I'm excited to share more about this project and discuss how data analysis can drive business growth and innovation. Feel free to reach out for further discussion or collaboration opportunities!
